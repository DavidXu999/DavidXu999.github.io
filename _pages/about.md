I am Shengwei Xu, a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan's School of Information, advised by [Prof. Grant Schoenebeck](https://schoeneb.people.si.umich.edu/). I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Peking University in 2021, advised by [Prof. Yuqing Kong](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/yuqkong/).


Research Interests
======
My current research focuses on the intersection between algorithmic game theory and AI technologies.

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
