I am Shengwei Xu, a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan's School of Information, advised by [Prof. Grant Schoenebeck](https://schoeneb.people.si.umich.edu/). I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Peking University in 2021, advised by [Prof. Yuqing Kong](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/yuqkong/).


Research Interests
======
My current research investigates strategic behavior in interactions between agents (human and AI) and algorithm, focusing on mechanism design, information elicitation, and their intersection with Large Language Models.
